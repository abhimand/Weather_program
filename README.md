#Preface

April 2020
Due to quarantine, I am finally fed up with playing video games and have decided this is the best time to learn some python before I start a full-time job. I set the idea to build a weather program since 1) it already exists which means I can mimic other designs like apple's weather app and 2) I can learn with a goal in mind already.
